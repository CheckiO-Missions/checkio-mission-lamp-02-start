<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p><i>
    This is the second mission in the lightbulb series. I will try to make each following task slightly more complex.
</i></p>

<p>
    You have already learned how to count the amount of time a light bulb has been on, or how long a room has been lit. Now let's add one more parameter - the counting start time.
</p>

<p>This means that the light continues to turn on and off as before. But now, as a result of the function, I want not only to know how long there was light in the room, but how long the room was lit, starting from a certain moment.</p>

<p> One more argument is added – <b>start_watching</b>, and if it’s not passed, we count as in the previous version of the program for the entire period.</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments and only the first one is required. The first one is {% if is_js %}an array of Date objects{% else %}a list of datetime objects{% endif %} and the second one is {% if is_js %}a Date object{% else %}a datetime object{% endif %}.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A number of seconds as an integer. 
</p>
