<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p><i>
    This is the second mission in the lightbulb series. I will try to make them more complex little by little. As is often the case with task requirements.
</i></p>

<p>
    You have already learned to count how long a light bulb has been on, or how long a room has been lit. Now let's add one more parameter - the counting start time.
</p>

<p>This means that the light continues to turn on and off as before. But now, as a result of the function, I want not only to know how long there was light in the room, but how long the room was lit, starting from a certain moment.</p>

<p> One more argument is added <pre>start_watching</pre>, and if it’s not passed, we count as in the previous version of the program - for the entire period.</p>
